# Hi, I'm Sheldon Ebron 👋

I'm a machine learning researcher and engineer with a **PhD in Computer Science** from the University of Memphis (August 2025). My research focuses on **privacy-preserving federated learning and adversarial ML defense**, developing algorithms that achieve **90% accuracy while blocking 80% of backdoor and inference attacks** in distributed learning systems.

I specialize in building secure, robust ML systems at scale and translating cutting-edge research into production-ready solutions.
